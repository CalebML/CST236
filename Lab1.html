<h1 class="title">Welcome to CST 236 Lab 1</h1>

<p><strong>If you have not already done so. Ensure you have completed the instructions
on blackboard.</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this lab is to familiarize yourselves with GIT, Python, RST Files, Sphinx and
DocTests. I have divided the lab up into the following categories:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Getting Python Setup</li>
<li>Coverting RST (this file)</li>
<li>Gitting to know Git</li>
<li>Getting to know nose2</li>
<li>Getting to know sphinx</li>
<li>Continous Integration</li>
<li>Lab write-up</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="getting-python-setup">
<h1>Getting Python Setup</h1>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">If you don't already have python 2.7.8 download and install it now</p>
</li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="converting-rst">
<h1>Converting RST</h1>
<p>Isn't this document format ugly? ReStructured text (RST) is a very powerful &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; markup format for creating documents.
I'm not sure about you but if you run &quot;rst2html.py Lab1.rst Lab1.html&quot; It looks a whole lot better. Granted it would look better with CSS but
it does accomplish the goal of making it easier to read.</p>
<p>ReStructured Test is especially useful when working with a GIT repo that works better with plain text files than complex binary (.doc/.chm) files.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Each lab for this class will end with a set of write-up questions that must be completed to get full credit for the lab. The write-up must
be submitted as part of the lab git repo and be in the form of RST capable of being converted using rst2html.</p>
</div>
<p>For more information about ReStructured Text see <a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html">RST</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gitting-to-know-git">
<h1>GITting to know GIT</h1>
<p>This lab will not cover every detail of how to use GIT. Instead I have provided a
brief overview on GIT. The expectation is that you research the additional details
about GIT using online resources such as Atlassian's <a class="reference external" href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/">Tutorial</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="creating-your-own-repo">
<h2>Creating your own Repo</h2>
<p>If you do not already have a GIT server setup you will now want to
go to github and register for an account and follow github's instructions
for creating a GIT repo.</p>
<p>The URL generated from this process is what you will want to clone locally
and send to me at the end of the lab.</p>
<p>Each lab should be committed as a branch to allow each referencing other
labs throughout this course. The master branch should be used to contain
a project template (one is provided under origin/lab1_template on the CST236
repo). As the class progresses it's highly recommended that you rebase
changes onto master that you feel would be useful in future labs.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
Master branch             Branch
|
O------------------------ Lab1
|________________________ Lab2
|
O
|
O
|
O
|
O------------------------- Lab3
</pre>
<p>In the above example lab1 and two are both branched off the same version of master
because there wasn't any new reusable code added on master. But after Lab2 you found
several plugins and such that you wanted to use on future labs so you added it to master
and branched Lab3 off the new head of master.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="your-first-commit">
<h2>Your first Commit</h2>
<p>No matter the repo no matter what the first commit to the repo should always
be to the .gitignore file. The reasoning for this is to ensure binary files
or other files are not checked in and essentially ruin the repo.</p>
<p>Often when working with GIT you will hear a lot of complaints about
binary files in a GIT repo. For the most binary files are only acceptable
if they are only going to be added and never or rarely modified. The issue
in GIT with binary files is that git does not store files it stores deltas.
This means on clones GIT downloads the complete list of changes (every commit
on every branch that has ever been made to a repo).</p>
<p>At first this seems less like a feature and more like a bug of GIT. But
statistically on text files like source code this is actually a much more
efficient way of storing files since statically most changes won't be total
re-writes of the files. Additionally this provides the user with the ability
to review the entire list of changes after a clone without needing to interact
with a server. In theory this would mean I can clone each of your repos for a
given lab board a plane with no wifi and grade each of your assignments by
the time I land.</p>
<p>The downfall to this model is binary files such as exes and bitmaps. Every time
an exe is complied a high percentage of the exe is changed. This means with each
commit containing a binary change the other collaborates have much more data to
fetch.</p>
<p>Now lets get ignoring the binary files out of the way.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Clone your repo locally</li>
<li>Open a git bash to the root of your repo</li>
<li>Execute &quot;touch .gitignore&quot;</li>
<li>Add &quot;<em>.exe&quot; and &quot;</em>.pyc&quot; to the .gitignore file</li>
<li>Add the file to the repo by executing &quot;git add .gitignore&quot;</li>
<li>Run &quot;git commit -a -m &quot;Added .gitignore file&quot;</li>
<li>Run &quot;git push&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>You have now made your first commit and pushed to the server with a message of &quot;Added .gitignore file&quot;</p>
<p>The following set of sections highlight the important git commands. there are many other commands available
and each command has many different parameters. It's highly recommended you spend time with each to
better understand GIT.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="switching-to-a-new-branch">
<h2>Switching to a new branch</h2>
<p>GIT branches are useful for collaboration reasons. Branches allow individual team members to
commit code to their personal branch to share with others without affecting the main (master)
branch.</p>
<p>Branching is also useful because they allow a team member to make as many commits
as they want and squash them before it's integrated into master. Squashing makes it so
that only one commit message shows up and avoids flooding other team members logs with
too many unnecessary commits.</p>
<p>One final reason for using branches in GIT is that a project can be setup to build branches
whenever a new commit is made. This allows developers and team members to know the build/test
status for each branch (useful for organizations that use integration branches)</p>
<p>A git branch can be created using &quot;git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]&quot;</p>
<p>To push a new branch use &quot;git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]&quot;</p>
<p>Use &quot;git branch&quot; to view a listing of all local branches. &quot;git branch -a&quot; to view all local and remote.
The branch indicated with &quot;*&quot; is your current branch.</p>
<p>Switch to the &quot;Lab1_example&quot; branch on the CST236 repo</p>
<p>The now checked out files contain the testing template that will be used for the remaining labs.
Copy these changes and check them into the master branch on your lab repo. Next create  branch called &quot;lab1&quot;
push it to the server. This is where the remaining changes for this lab should be pushed(Unless you find
something that might be useful to have available on all labs)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rebasing-a-branch">
<h2>Rebasing a Branch</h2>
<p>Rebasing a branch is useful when you have changes on a branch that you want on the master branch.</p>
<p>This can be accomplished using the &quot;git rebase&quot; command</p>
<p>Cherry picking allows grabbing a single commit from a branch and adding it to the current branch.</p>
<p>This can be accomplished using the &quot;git cherry-pick&quot; command</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="viewing-the-log">
<h2>Viewing the Log</h2>
<p>Using the &quot;git log&quot; command you are able to see many details and commit history for the
current branch. There are many parameters to git log. Review these parameters and try
out a few to better understand git log</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="diffing-two-revisions">
<h2>Diffing two revisions</h2>
<p>Using the &quot;git diff&quot; command you can diff two commits or even the file itself that was changed
Review the parameters and try out a few to better understand git diff.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="squashing-two-commits">
<h2>Squashing two commits</h2>
<p>One of the nice features of GIT is you can make many commits locally without pushing and they will provide you
with restore points as you develop your feature locally. When it's time to push to an integration branch or
master you will likely want to squash those changes to have all your changes in a single commit. The advantage
of this is you won't flood your fellow engineer's git log.</p>
<p>Research the different ways to squash git commits</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reverting-changes-to-the-last-commit">
<h2>Reverting Changes to the last Commit</h2>
<p>Using the &quot;git revert&quot; you can undo changes or cleanup unneed files.</p>
<div class="note">

<div class="section" id="getting-to-nose-nose2">
<h1>Getting to nose nose2</h1>
<p>Nose2 is one of many various unit test tools that are available for python.
The majority of these testing tools use test framework called unittest or pyunit (if doing a
google search).</p>
<p>The difference in the case of Nose2 and pyunit here is that pyunit is what your test is
written as (in a moment we will see that test classes all inherit from the pyunit modules).
Tools like Nose2 automates finding and running multiple pyunit tests.</p>
<p>What nose2 provides us:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Discovery of and execution of pyunit tests</li>
<li>Converts results into multiple formats (html, junit, etc)</li>
<li>Automates running of coverage</li>
<li>Can be setup to run tests in parallel</li>
<li>Expandable to allow you to write your own plugins ( <a class="reference external" href="http://nose2.readthedocs.org/">http://nose2.readthedocs.org/</a> )</li>
</ul>
<p>In my cst236 repo that I have provided for you on the Lab1 branch I have provided a sample
setup and test for you to look at and better understand nose.</p>
<p>In the root of the repo you will see a file named nose2.cfg. Nose2.cfg tells nose how you
would like nose2 to be executed. It also provides ways to add additional plugins and configure
those plugins. The contents of the file are as such:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
[unittest]                          # All settings after this is for unittest (main plugin)
start-dir = .                       # Where to execute the tests from
code-directories = source           # The location where the code to be tested is located
test-file-pattern = *_test.py       # Defines the pattern to look for when discovering tests (This means every test file must end with _test.py
plugins = tests.plugins.coverage    # Defines plugins we wish to utilize (in this case we are using a coverage plugin from tests/plugins/coverage
exclude-plugins = nose2.plugins.coverage
                                    # Defines plugins we wish to disable and not use. In this case we are not using nose2 coverage and using our own plugin instead.

[output-buffer]                     # Output buffer is a useful plugin that can be used to capture output from tests
always-on = True
stderr = True
stdout = True

[log-capture]                       # Log capture is used to capture logging output from tests
always-on = True
clear-handlers = True
log-level = DEBUG
</pre>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">In the example above each line in the nose2.cfg file must not be indented and must
be at column 0 of their respective lines.</p>
</div>
<p>Now lets take a look at an actual test procedures. The sample test procedure ('source1_test.py')
is located in the tests folder. The term test procedure is used to refer to a logical
grouping of test cases. With python this is typically a .py file (like the example source1_test).
Many times projects prefer test procedures to be a one to one relationship with the source code
module that they test. So in this case source1_test tests source1.py in the source folder.</p>
<p>If you open the source1_test file you will first notice that we import the function we plan on testing.
This import can be either a function import, module import, or class import. No matter what
you must import the code you plan on testing. The next thing you will see is the line importing
TestCase.</p>
<p>TestCases are a grouping of steps that verify that the code when given some input will provide the
expected output. In most cases the TestCases should test a single function (regardless of whether
that function is in a class).</p>
<p>To implement a test case you want to first name it something that indicates what is being tested.
in the sample I provided the TestCase &quot;TestGetTriangleType&quot; is used to verify the output from
the function get_triangle_type. TestGetTriangleType inherits from the TestCase so that pyunit
registers this class as a TestCase and will execute it. If our class was not a child or
descendent of TestCase then the tests inside the class would not run.</p>
<p>Next up we have the test_step itself. We see 'test_get_triangle_equilateral_all_int' when writing unit tests
we want to make the code as verbose as to what is going on as possible but at the same time we want to avoid
lengthy commenting as it creates clutter and maintenance issues. This is why the test step name is so lengthy
because the test step name indicates exactly what is being tested in that step. You will notice that
the function begins with '<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">test_</span></a>' this is another requirement of pyunit. If a function inside of
a TestCase does not begin with '<a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">test_</span></a>' then it will not be called as a test step. This does
not mean you can't add other functions. In actuality I and other testers would encourage use
of helper functions or class or modules. It's just important to note that they will note be called
unless one of your test steps call them.</p>
<p>Inside of the two test steps provided you will see two lines. The first is calling 'get_triange_type'
the second is verifying the return from the function. Each test step allows you to add as many
setup up, function calls, etc that you want. Likewise you can compare as many values as you wish.
From a maintenance standpoint it's much better if each of your test steps are singular. This means
that each test step should be only as long as it needs to be to verify the functionality it intends.
In the example provided you can tell by the step name that we are verifying that get_triangle_type
will return equilateral when equilateral lengths are provided in the form of floats.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">In the example I have split this into two function because we are clearly testing two
separate program paths and functionality. By splitting this I make it easier for
future test writers to understand what I was testing.</p>
</div>
<p>There are hundreds of different comparison functions available through <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertEqual">pyunit</a></p>
<p>If there is a comparison that isn't natively covered in pyunit that you plan on using
often you always have the option to add it as a member function to your local test case
class. In my job I've often found it helpful to create base tests that I can add common
functionality to so that all my tests can reuse my custom comparisons. For example you
could create something like:
unittest.TestCase =&gt; ProjectBaseTest =&gt; SpecificTestCaseClass.</p>
<p>Finally, there are a number of functions in TestCase that can be overwritten to aid in testing.
The major functions most commonly overwritten is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>setUp: called before each test function. Useful when there is some operation that needs to occur before each test</li>
<li>tearDown: called after each test function executes. Useful if there is some cleanup that needs to occur after each function</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running your first Nose2 Test</h2>

<div class="section" id="getting-to-know-sphinx">
<h1>Getting to know Sphinx</h1>
<p>Sphinx documentation utilizes in line documentation (function comments see get_triangle_type for example) and
ReStructured Text to create end user documentation. This allows the code changes to automatically be updated in
the resulting code.</p>
<p>I've included a template for documenting the source1.py file in the doc folder. This can be built using the following</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
cd doc
make html
</pre>
<p>This will create an index.html in build/html. View this file to get an idea of what this looks like.</p>
<p>** Now build a rst doc for the source file for four sided objects that was created earlier **</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Don't forget to add your new rst file to the index to make it accessible</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-doctests">
<h2>Creating DocTests</h2>
<p>Sphinx doctests are useful in that they allow you to embedded checks in code or RST files that checks that changes
to the code are updated in the associated documentation. Imagine the case where you have some defined API but then
you change some of the parameters. If the associated documentation is not updated you'll have a very unhappy customer.</p>
<p>This is where doctests come into play. Doctests provide a check and doctests also get printed to the html output.
There are two ways to include doc tests</p>
<div class="section" id="simple-doctests">
<h3>Simple doctests</h3>
<p>The simplest method of including a doctest is using the &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; operator. For example:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; print x + y
3
</pre>
<p>In the above example the code will be displayed exactly how it is included in the comment or RST.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="complex-doctests">
<h3>Complex doctests</h3>
<p>Complex doc tests split up tests into 3 - 4 different groups.
* Test setups: provide a set of code to execute before the test specified (does not show up in html)
* Test code: The actual test that gets executed (shows up in HTML)
* Test output: The expected output from executing the test code (shows up in HTML)
* Test cleanup: Steps to take after a test to cleanup after the test (does not show up in html)</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
.. testsetup:: *

    x = 1
    y = 2

.. testcode:: addition

    print x + y

.. testoutput:: addition

    3
</pre>
<p>In the above example by indicating '*' for the test setup we are indicating that this setup should be performed for
every testcode block in the file. If we changes that to 'addition' the test setup will only be performed
prior to for the addition testcode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="executing-doctests">
<h3>Executing doctests</h3>
<p>By using the same make as building the html doc above we can execute doctests by running:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
make doctest
</pre>
<p>** Now create doctests for using both simple and complex doctests. **</p>

<div class="section" id="continuous-integration">
<h1>Continuous Integration</h1>
<p>Since testing that has only been executed on a single computer can fail to reveal flaws in both the source code
and the tests. Tests and results which are not consistent and reproducible are useful. Plus how will we be able to
detect the next time that Gaben breaks the build again?</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Go to <a class="reference external" href="http://drone.io">Drone.IO</a></li>
<li>Register Drone IO with your github account.</li>
<li>Connect Drone to build your nose2 and doctests.</li>
<li>Setup drone to build the nose2 and doctests the same way you built them locally.</li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You will want to make sure this will build each branch. This means drone will build each of your builds</li>

<li>What is the difference between a git cherry pick and a rebase?</li>
<li>How could you use git to print out just the author name of a given file for the current version of the repo?</li>
<li>During this lab did you explore Tortoise Git or GIT Extensions? If not take a look at them, they probably would be useful for the remainder of the class</li>
